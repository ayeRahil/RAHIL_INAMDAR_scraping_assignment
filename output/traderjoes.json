On tasting it, you’ll likely first notice its rich, luxuriously thick consistency, then the savory, umami-filled notes of its white miso paste base, which perfectly leads into the pleasantly tart tones of its mixed-in yuzu zest and yuzu juice. Then, once you’ve had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it..\nRead More",

A bit like a localized, Thai-cuisine-informed variation of chow fun (which was likely a direct inspiration), pad see ew is traditionally made with wide, flat rice noodles, which are fried in a wok with various veggies and garlic before being finished with a splash of light and dark soy sauce to give it a bold, savory, and umami-rich flavor. And that’s the same, time-tested technique that our supplier in Thailand uses when making Trader Joe’s Pad See Ew, a rich, flavorful, and totally vegan version of this classic dish that’s now available in our freezers.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Pulled Chicken Salsa Verde is one of those products that checks all the boxes!\nSimilar to Trader Joe’s Smoked Pulled Chicken, this Pulled Chicken recipe begins with seasoned, boneless, skinless Chicken breast. But here, the meat isn’t smoked. It’s seasoned with salt, white pepper, and garlic & onion powders, then slow-cooked in a Salsa Verde that includes roasted tomatillos, green chiles, cilantro, onion and garlic. The fully cooked meat is then shredded, so its really easy to tuck into tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or to pile on top of chips for nachos. And it’ll save you time on a busy weeknight, since all it takes to prepare is about four minutes in the microwave. Add a couple more minutes to that if you’d prefer to heat it in a saucepan on the stovetop. Either way, you’ll have a terrifically tender & flavorful protein you can use in a wide variety of simple, satisfying ways.\nRead More",

After roasting, the corn is individually quick frozen to ensure freshness and allow you to use what you like now and save the rest for another time.\nIf you’re looking for a versatile side dish, our Roasted Corn may just fit the bill. The corn is great by itself and fits great with a variety of other combinations, especially in ethnic dishes. Once cooked, toss the amount of Corn you would like to use for a Mexican-style salad with Organic Black Beans, quinoa, cilantro, topped with sweet peppers, onions, avocado and creamy, Cilantro Dressing with crumbled cotija cheese. The Corn makes for a delicious Elote in a cup, also known as Esquites. Just like you would on a corn on the cob, add Real Mayonnaise, grated Cotija Cheese, chili powder, and a Trader Joe’s touch with our crushed Elote Chips. You’ll find each 16-ounce bag of Trader Joe’s Roasted Corn in our freezers.\nRead More",

And lucky for you, Trader Joe’s Organic Mango Vinaigrette Dressing deftly incorporates each of these attributes, setting the table for some fantastically fresh, summer fare.\nA fairly simple blend of organic mango purée, vegetable oil, distilled white vinegar, and cane sugar (plus organic orange juice concentrate, dried red bell peppers, and garlic powder for added vim and vigor), our Organic Mango Vinaigrette lends itself to all sorts of applications. You can, of course, add a splash to salads (spinach + feta + toasted almonds + Organic Mango Vinaigrette = yum), or you can use it as a marinade for grilled chicken. Or as a fancy inclusion for fish tacos. Or as the star of a cold noodle dish or pasta salad...\nRead More",

We call them “pros” because it’s very challenging to fill and keep closed such small ravioli. After a year of research (no joke!)—and equipped with a new, specially made die to cut the pasta—our Raviolini line was up and running.\nEach Raviolini is 50% pasta and 50% filling, which is a rare ratio in the stuffed-pasta universe. The pasta is formed from a delicate, egg and durum-wheat flour dough. The filling includes spinach in a creamy, garlicky bechamel sauce, with a rich blend of ricotta & mozzarella cheeses.\nRead More",

And texture-wise, the tooth-sinking smoothness of dark chocolate superbly rounds out a pistachio’s tender interior after its initial, delicately snappy bite.

The fully cooked meat is then shredded, so its really easy to tuck into tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or to pile on top of chips for nachos. And it’ll save you time on a busy weeknight, since all it takes to prepare is about four minutes in the microwave.

        "description": "In Scandinavia, rye has been a staple since at least the Middle Ages. But why rye? The key to rye’s rise lies in this grassy crop’s ability to flourish in a colder climate. It also had to do with rye’s dense, earthy, and pleasantly sour character when milled and used in baked goods. Trader Joe’s Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips capitalize on rye’s goodness by delivering this dark, delicious grain in a crisp, seedy cracker.\n \nA bakery in Norway makes our Sourdough Rye Chips. First, they bake bread from a wheat and rye sourdough that includes whole-grain rye berries, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds. The bread is thinly sliced, fried in sunflower oil, and finished with a touch of salt. Each curved, irregularly shaped Chip has a super crunch that leads to nutty notes and rich rye flavor.\n \nWe enjoy Trader Joe’s Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips as a snack right out of the bag, but you can also use them to add crunch to your salad. And they’re strong enough for dipping into something savory, such as Chunky Artichoke Jalapeño Dip. For a more substantial snack, pair them with Oak Smoked Salmon Pieces and thin slices of Denmark Havarti.\nRead More",

While we’d never throw shade at a nightshade in any form, we’d like to posit that peckish Peter Piper would have been even more pleased had he picked up a peck—er, a bag—of Trader Oven Dried Red & Yellow Bell Pepper Crisps instead! \nMade for us in Turkey with three simple ingredients—red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, and sea salt—our Oven Dried Bell Pepper Crisps are an ideal anecdote to a sudden craving for some savory crunch, sans additives. Our supplier takes a 50/50 blend of fresh (not frozen) Bell Pepper slices, sprinkles them with sea salt, then dries (not fries) them in not one, but separate ovens. (Perhaps we should have gone with Oven Dried?) The first pass through the oven prepares the peppers by slowly reducing their moisture levels, and the second dries them to peak crispiness. Snacks don’t get anymore straightforward than this...\nRead More",

It’s a luxuriously smooth, velvety Oil is made from avocados grown Mexico, which offers an ideal avo-growing climate. This delicate, buttery oil is naturally high in monounsaturated fats (10 grams per serving), and with a roughly 500oF smoke point, it makes an excellent cooking oil. (For reference, olive oil has a smoke point closer to 350oF). Its clean, delicate flavor is a great match for all kinds of applications, from sautéing to baking to searing to garnishing.\nRead More",

Even beyond the “super-fruit” status of strawberries, this Sorbet has other superb qualities going for it. Our supplier in Thailand starts with locally harvested strawberries that have a balanced, sweet & tart flavor, which translates sensationally when blended with water & cane sugar to form the smooth Sorbet base. Then, they add Strawberry pieces to amp up the texture and augment the Super Strawberry flavor.\nRead More",

The steers’ primary diet is supplied by the lush, low-lying grasslands of the South American Pampas, and is rounded out with corn and grain to impart the desired marbling in this boneless cut. Because marbling equals fat, and fat equals flavor, it follows that the quality of the finished Ribeye Steak boasts truly melt-in-your-mouth flavor, on par with anything you’d find in an Argentinian or Brazilian steakhouse— minus the steakhouse price tag, of course.\nRead More",

This tasty twist starts by shaking up the classic formula with a base of chopped kale in addition to the customary Romaine, then mixes things up further via the use of crunchy Parmesan cheese crisps instead of croutons. It’s finished with a hearty portion of grilled salmon, which, when mixed all together with the included creamy Romano Caesar dressing, creates a marvelous mix of savory flavors and toothsome textures that all combine into one seriously satisfying salad.\nRead More",

The very first ingredient is USDA certified Organic Beef that comes from Grass Fed cows, yielding delicious flavor. You’ll also find sea salt and celery powder in the ingredients. These serve not so much as flavoring, but to effectively “cure” our Uncured Dogs, allowing us to leave out unwanted preservatives, such as nitrates & nitrites. What else goes into our Organic Uncured Grass Fed Beef Hot Dogs? The rest of the ingredients are all organic seasonings, things like garlic puree, minced onion, paprika, and red pepper flakes.

After this, they’re heated, which causes a curious reaction where the frozen water within the berries instantly transitions to a vapor, skipping the liquid phase entirely. And since raspberries are mostly water, what remains of each raspberry is super concentrated with their signature, sweet-tart flavor–in fact, it takes more than a half a pound of fresh raspberries to make each 1.2-ounce pouch of our Freeze Dried Raspberries.\nRead More",

People use it liberally to add verve to all kinds of dishes, from stir-frys and noodle soups—to meats and vegetables. Just a little transforms bland white rice into something of a meal. And when it comes to recipes, it often serves as the base for sauces and marinades.\nDespite its popularity, soy sauce’s saltiness (say that ten times fast!) also means high sodium—something more and more people are choosing to avoid. Accordingly, the only soy sauce we sell is Trader Joe’s Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce. With 530mg of sodium per 1 Tbsp. serving, it contains about 50% less sodium than leading soy sauce brands. Lower sodium aside, our Soy Sauce is made with the traditional Honjozo method, which uses a 6 month to 2 year natural brewing and fermentation approach. This means Trader Joe’s Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce tastes authentic and is ideal for all your soy sauce needs. We’re pretty sure you won’t even notice the missing sodium!\nRead More",

The obvious answer is that a lot of entertaining goes on in the late fall through early winter, and a box containing a variety of tasty cookie treats is a welcome dessert option for most hosts. But it’s also true that people entertain friends and family all year round. This thought led us to entertain the idea of a cookie assortment for the warmer months... which led us to one of our long-time cookie suppliers in Belgium... which led to the creation of Trader Joe’s Belgian Cookie Assortment!\nRead More",

They’re packed with fruit filling, and really deliver on the promised flavor profile. They’re low in fat and sodium, and they’re individually wrapped for your convenience. And on top of all that, they taste great! What, you think we’re joking? No way. These bars are the real deal, raising the (cereal) bar for great taste.\nRead More",

Still, it’s enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a creamier texture—a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases.\nRead More",

More specifically, it’s our take on takikomi gohan, a traditional Japanese style of rice flavored with soy sauce and mirin (a tangy rice wine). Our version contains shelled edamame, pieces of deep fried tofu, and thin strips of hijiki seaweed. What’s inside the package is fully cooked—you can heat it in minutes in a microwave or skillet or wok—and works brilliantly as either a side with a larger Japanese-inspired meal or as the main dish for a vegetarian feast. You could also go the fusion route and serve it topped with Sriracha and a fried egg. You’ll find it alongside the other fried rice options in our freezers.\nRead More",

Mini Ice Cream Cones begin with a crispy, crunchy cone, lined with rich and flavorful chocolate. Next, these mini, chocolate-lined treasures are piped full of thick, creamy Chocolate ice cream. The Ice Cream is so deliciously dense because it contains only around 50% overrun (that’s ice cream lingo for the amount of air whipped into the ice cream to expand its volume), which is impressive when you consider that most ice cream used in frozen novelties contains around 90% overrun. Finally, the Cones are dipped—upside down, no less!—in more of that fine, fine chocolate.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of Chinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile.\nThis concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms their wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each dumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth—broth made from ingredients includ- ing chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means “wrapped” in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.\nRead More",

By “roasted,” we don’t mean they were briefly passed over a flame to make them look charred. Our supplier near Bologna, Italy has really roasted these vegetables until they achieved their inviting look and taste. And rather than dicing them, they’ve chopped these veggies in longer strips to provide more textural interest for your tongue and the more distinguishable flavor from bite to bite. These colorful, plentiful vegetables sit atop a crisp and chewy sourdough crust (made from a long-rise dough) that is spread with a well-seasoned tomato sauce and sprinkled with a blend of mozzarella and hard aged cheese. The taste experience alone is enough to make you forget about pepperoni—at least for a few minutes.\nRead More",

From pizza crusts, to rice, to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. We recently found ourselves asking this question once again with the discovery of Trader Joe's Cauliflower Slims, an ingenious bread substitute made from sheets of shredded cauliflower baked together with egg, Parmesan cheese, and nutritional yeast. Take it from us: once you make a sandwich with cauliflower, you'll find yourself wondering if cauliflower's wonders ever cease, too. Perfectly sized for a number of uses - including as a vehicle for avocado toast, a tortilla or pita, or even as a kind of savory, cheesy pancake, if you're so inclined - these Cauliflower Slims provide all the structure and texture of flatbread with a fraction of the carbs (only three grams of carbs per serving of two Slims, to be precise!). And since each Slim is made with Parmesan and nutritional yeast baked right in, every bite is filled with a nice, savory cheesy flavor that complements deli meats, condiments, and sauces wonderfully.\nRead More",

When exposed to the elements (air, heat, water), piperine can break down. Our Black Peppercorns come whole and packaged in their own Grinder, which is a benefit to maintaining freshness, along with a culinary convenience. Remove the cap, turn the jar upside down and twist to get pure, piquant flecks of black pepper. Or you can screw off the cap if you need to add some whole peppercorns to your pot. To add depth and vibrancy to flavors, grind our Black Peppercorns over eggs, steak, mashed potatoes, pasta, soup, sprouts, freshly sliced tomatoes, strawberries...you get the picture.\nRead More",

While the ‘stuffing’ and ‘something’ can vary widely, rice and grape leaves are a classic, vegetarian Dolmas combination. So; that’s what we went with for Trader Joe’s Dolmas.\nTrader Joe’s Dolmas are made by a Greek company in Evia, the isle shaped like a seahorse. Okay, they’re not just any Greek company; they’re the largest Dolmas (Ntolmadakia) producer in the world, with more than 50 years of experience under their vine leaves. They deliver authenticity and are adept in their stuffing of somethings. Trader Joe’s Dolmas are crafted according to an age-old, Mediterranean recipe, using tender vine leaves. By hand, the leaves are stuffed, one by one, with a soft, succulent white rice that’s mixed with chopped onions, bits of dill and mint. Dexterously rolled and folded, the leaves and rice are transformed into two-bite morsels, which are cooked to marry flavors and create a moist, tender bite. Packed in soy oil, they eat like they were freshly prepared and promise a little spice, a little savory and a little tang. Enjoy them cold, as a snack, or serve them warm with a dipping sauce – Tzatziki, lemon tahini (tahini, lemon juice & garlic - blended), or greek yogurt & fresh dill – for an iconic meze. They pair well with a dry white, like a Sauvignon Blanc.\nRead More",

Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates.\nWhat makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream “French”, you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself (which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream. Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream!\nRead More",

        "description": "There is not much to say about what’s in Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter. This Peanut Butter is made with just two ingredients: peanuts and salt. That’s it. The ingredients don’t necessarily say a whole lot (it is just two ingredients), but it actually does. It goes without saying that there are no sweeteners, binders, or added oils and that speaks volumes about our Peanut Butter. The peanuts are dry roasted, made into the most delicious, Crunchy and Salted Peanut Butter.\nRead More",

        "description": "We’ve heard people talk about “bitter” dark chocolate, and indeed, we’ve tasted our share of bitter-over-all-else dark chocolate. You may be tempted to assume that Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Lover’s Chocolate Bar, with 85% Cacao, would stand with the bitter faction. But we all know what happens when you assume, right?\nOkay, then. This really is a dark chocolate lover’s chocolate bar. Chocolate from Colombia’s Tumaco region is known for its fruity flavor profile, and ours doesn’t disappoint. The rich, 85% cacao has a bit of sugar and natu- ral vanilla flavor that enhances the cacao’s natural flavor and takes away much of the bitterness typically associ- ated with dark dark chocolate bars. Our supplier grows the cocoa beans, harvests the beans, roasts the beans and turns them into chocolate. They also make and package the individual bars for Trader Joe’s. Generally, all of these processes are done by individual companies & craftspeople. By keeping it all in one place, we are better able to control both quality and cost.\nRead More",

Now a favorite among foodies the world over, the popularity of satay skewers has brought with it a commensurate appreciation for satay sauce (also known as sambal kacang.)

This French-style flatbread has been a favorite in our freezers since 2006, boasting an umami-rich, cozy construction that makes it an especially apt choice to combat the winter’s chill. It starts with a thin, crisp crust with hand-braided edges, topped with crème fraîche and a velvety Emmental cheese sauce. Next, white mushrooms and oyster mushrooms are added in abundance—and it’s their intense, woody, earthy flavors that elevate this flatbread to its deserved level of distinction. Finally, a dusting of Parmesan Reggiano adds a pleasant sharpness to complement the luxuriously creamy sauce and funky fungi. \nRead More",

Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don’t break down into an entirely smooth paste. This difference contributes to the Cracker’s unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news—the soy sauce in this snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat.

        "description": "When you’re longing for the ease of a bake-and-serve pizza with the flair of French cuisine, look no further than Trader Joe’s Tarte aux Champignons. This French-style flatbread has been a favorite in our freezers since 2006, boasting an umami-rich, cozy construction that makes it an especially apt choice to combat the winter’s chill. It starts with a thin, crisp crust with hand-braided edges, topped with crème fraîche and a velvety Emmental cheese sauce. Next, white mushrooms and oyster mushrooms are added in abundance—and it’s their intense, woody, earthy flavors that elevate this flatbread to its deserved level of distinction. Finally, a dusting of Parmesan Reggiano adds a pleasant sharpness to complement the luxuriously creamy sauce and funky fungi. \nRead More",

Huzzah! \nThis trio of Shaved Cheeses is made for us in Wisconsin, using authentic Italian cheese-making techniques; each Cheese is made with raw milk from cows not treated with rBST and aged a minimum of five months (the Parmesan is aged for 10 months).

Dare we say, we did! Trader Joe’s Sweet & Salty Umami Crunchies Rice Crackers are made with Japonica rice, a short grain, non-glutinous varietal. Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don’t break down into an entirely smooth paste. This difference contributes to the Cracker’s unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news—the soy sauce in this snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat.

Those luxuriant fields are also great at nourishing cows that produce incomparably rich milk, making traditional goudas (such as our Red Wax Gouda) the brazenly buttery cheese they are.

However, Trader Joe’s Feta Cheese isn’t packaged in a saline brine, making for a dry and tangy, but more neutral and less salty cheese than its brined siblings.

        "description": "A true building block of many East Asian cuisines, the origins of rice vinegar date somewhere between four and five thousand years ago to ancient China. It’s traditionally made by fermenting rice wine, and over its long and storied history has been used as everything from a flavoring agent, to a preservative, to beverage in its own right. It comes in a variety of colors ranging from red, to white, to brown and black, and is sometimes seasoned with sugar or other flavorings. Trader Joe’s Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it’s certainly not lacking for flavor. Tart, tangy, and just a touch sweet, with a slightly sharp note for cutting through and brightening other flavors, it’s an ideal ingredient for adding to salad dressings, sauces, and marinades of all kinds.\n \nA bit of our Rice Vinegar will add an extra dimension of flavor to stir-fries, soups, and even just a freshly cooked pot of plain white rice. When mixed with soy sauce, it makes an excellent condiment for any of our gyoza or soup dumpling options, though we’ll leave the exact ratio to your personal tastes (some prefer equal parts soy sauce to Rice Vinegar, others enjoy two parts Vinegar to one part soy sauce). And when making quick pickles or a last-minute seaweed salad, our Rice Vinegar is nothing short of a must-have.\nRead More",

It seems like a negligible distinction, but we take such distinctions seriously—especially when it comes to Trader Joe’s Cream Cheese.\nWithin the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a “brick.” Brick, however, sounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not treated with rBST, it’s everything you want cream cheese to be—rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread- able. So, rather than “brick,” we’d like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a “block,” as in “building block,” since it can be a building block in so many delicious dishes.\nRead More",

        "description": "Made for us in California by the best boulangers we’ve found this side of the Atlantic, Trader Joe’s Raspberry Croissant Carré starts, as all good things do, with a classic laminated dough (a.k.a. dough that’s been repeatedly folded with layers of butter to create the flaky Croissant eating experience). The dough is paired with a tart Raspberry filling that’s been sweetened with a bit of sugar and complemented with a touch of lemon juice to further amplify the fruit. But rather than rolling them into the classic Croissant shape, the layers of dough are sandwiched around the jammy filling, like a coffee cake—a sedimentary construction that allows for the inclusion of much more filling than you’d find in an individual croissant.

Pour the batter into a greased 8x8-inch square pan, and then bake! With a simple spread of whipped butter or a drizzle of honey, you’ll be in cornbread heaven in no time (okay, some time – about 35 minutes). You could also spoon the batter into a muffin pan for single-serve Cornbread muffins that are excellent paired with Organic Vegetarian Chili.\nRead More",

Better yet, it’s made with just a few ingredients: unbleached wheat flour, water, sea salt, yeast, and malted barley. Though our supplier makes large quantities of bread, they are still able to achieve the sought-after artisanal taste and texture.

And now, with Trader Joe’s Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts, they’ve quickly climbed to the top of our list for sweet, spicy, and saucy side dishes, too! This addition to our refrigerated case is made for us with whole Brussels Sprouts, roasted to a tender, toothsome texture, and are tossed in a zesty, full-flavored sauce made with a mix of hoison, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and chili peppers.

And while it’s easy enough to cook up a chicken breast when you need it, you really can’t beat the convenience of our Premium Chicken Breast in Water. You can keep it in your pantry until you need it for whatever comes to mind. Make a quick Chicken salad with the ingredients of your choice – we like a bit of mayo mixed with some curry powder, chopped celery and a handful of raisins or dried cherries. Combine the Premium Chicken with some chicken broth, black beans, canned corn, Homestyle Salsa Especial, Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend, and tortilla chips for a super quick and delightfully delicious chicken tortilla soup. Add it to a green salad for an easy protein boost.\nRead More",

We put that theory into practice with Trader Joe’s Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados.

        "description": "Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe’s Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip? Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and deeply, aromatically garlicky appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream cheese, mozzarella, and Asiago, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.\nRead More",

Sure, there have been contenders for the crown over the years, but with all respect to the soups and salads of the world, nothing quite complements a sandwich as well as the briny, herby flavor and juicy, satisfying crunch that only pickles can provide. And Trader Joe’s Kosher Dill Pickle Spears, available now in our refrigerators, are particularly proficient at providing both of those crucial elements. Much of that is owed to the fact that our supplier cold-packs them in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and even more resounding crunch at lunch.\nRead More",

All in all, this cereal is a sweet combination of those three nuts and four grains - oats, rice, corn, and wheat. Every bite boasts a wide variety of crunchy textures and toasty flavors, plus a lively note of rich toffee, turning any rote, mundane breakfast into something a little more special. \n \nEnjoy Trader Joe’s Super Nutty Oat Clusters in the classic way, poured into a bowl with milk or non-dairy alternative (such as a dairy free beverage like our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage for even more variety). Enjoy it mixed with your other favorite nuts or dried fruit for a quick trek mix to stow on the go. And for a texturally tantalizing sweet treat, simply sprinkle it over your favorite yogurt with a spoonful of your favorite fruit preserves for an effortless parfait.\nRead More",

Amazingly, they’ve achieved this texture without the use of thickeners or gums—additives that are present in most of the other coconut milk brands you’ll find in the marketplace.

Since we’re in prime pumpkin season, we figure it’s as good a time as any to expound on the excellence of Trader Joe’s Cut Butternut Squash. When you begin with a whole squash at home, you have your work cut out for you. Peeling, chopping, seeding, cleaning… there’s a good amount of effort involved in making Butternuts “recipe ready.” Our Cut Butternut, on the other hand, is peeled, seeded, and cut into evenly sized cubes, making it “recipe-ready” for almost any fall-forward cooking endeavor. Roast, steam, or even cook in the microwave. Purée them, mash them, add them to a casserole. Create sides, soups, and baked goods. The uses for our Cut Butternut Squash are plentiful, as will be your free time when you add this veggie to your repertoire.\nRead More",

It has long been an ingredient in Eastern and Central European cuisines, making its way to the U.S. and U.K. through westward immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since been kept on hand to tame picante Tex-Mex dishes, as well as make quick dips and silky sauces. With a pure and simple ingredient list, Trader Joe’s Sour Cream delivers the freshest pasteurized cream, milk, corn starch, and live and active cultures ready for you to use on your culinary adventures!

Fate only deigns to give us iconic duos like these every once in a great while, so when it does, it’s our job to appreciate them to the fullest extent possible. We’re certainly doing our part with the introduction of Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Chocolate Granola. Made with a base of sweet, crunchy, rolled oats that have been flavored with savory, lightly salty peanut butter, and sprinkled with chunks of rich, dark chocolate, every splendid spoonful of this full-flavored Granola is like an edible tribute to this preeminent flavor partnership.\nRead More",

The sweet raisins and aromatic cinnamon make it seem like a special baked treat, one that’s elevated even further by a simple warm up in the toaster. And yet, it’s just a bit of bread—not a donut or a slice of cake—so it never quite corsses the line into “dessert” territory!\nWe want all our customers to have the Cinnamon Raisin Bread experience, and that’s why we’re bringing Trader Joe’s Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread back to our bakery shelves. Reformulated with a new recipe that no longer includes eggs (which means it’s now also vegan!), this hearty loaf smells and tastes just like classic Cinnamon Raisin Bread—because it is! All we’ve done is replaced the wheat flour with a combination of brown rice flour and tapioca flour. Husked brown rice is finely ground and used as the primary substitute for wheat flour. The tapioca flour—derived from the root of the cassava plant from South America—helps provide some of the crispness and chew that’s often missing in other gluten free breads.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Kimbap, for example, takes a veggie-forward approach. Our supplier, a kimbap expert in the Republic of Korea, arranges an assortment of sauteed greens, crunchy root vegetables, and crisp pickles around a base of braised tofu, wraps it all in a layer of rice and seaweed, then slices it into two-or-three-bite-sized rounds.\nRead More",

They use the Smyrna variety of fig, known for its seedy, pink flesh and pale green skin. (Fun fact: when this fig variety was initially transported to California for production, its name was changed: Calimyrna figs are the same as Smyrna figs, but grown in California rather than Turkey.) Here, that pink, seedy interior takes on a crispy texture, and delivers the expected figgy flavors with aplomb. These are great for snacking anytime, excellent in a bowl of cereal, and will liven up a cheese & charcuterie board on both the flavor and texture fronts.\nRead More",

Before such an invention, one had to chop the head, rinse the leaves, rinse them again (and maybe again), and then dry them using either the slow ‘air-dry’ technique—or far too many paper towels. So… let us give thanks for bagged lettuce—specifically Trader Joe’s Organic Romaine & Chicory Blend.\nRead More",

With no dark, outer leaves to trim away, you can use the whole heart, and simply enjoy the fruits of this verdant, versatile vegetable. \n \nRomaine, the modern descendant of the oldest of all lettuce types, adds a delightful, crunchy texture to mixed green salads. In fact, it’s the lettuce of choice for a Caesar, Niçoise, or Cobb salad—a triple threat, if we’ve ever seen one. Romaine leaves bring excellent crunch to a burger or sandwich, and are an excellent option for using as a wrap or lettuce cup. Did you know? Romaine Hearts can even be grilled! Wash the whole Heart, then split it in half and brush with olive oil, grill just until char marks appear, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with or without salad dressing. Now that’s what we call Heart-warming!\nRead More",

In addition to providing an impressive two grams of fiber and three grams of protein per two-slice serving, this mix makes the bread soft and flavorful, instead of tough or grainy.

The only trouble, of course, is that when you’re in that something-scrumptious-yet-simple kind of mood, you usually don’t have the time or the temperament to fire up a grill. That’s why we offer our frozen Trader Joe’s Grilled Chicken Strips. Each bag contains a pound of fully-cooked white chicken meat that’s been seasoned with just a touch of savory spices, then cut into highly servable strips. And since they only take a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop to go from frozen to steamy, juicy, and ready-to-eat, it’s never been easier to put protein on your plate.\n \nIf you regularly prep school or work lunches, you’ll especially appreciate how quick, convenient, and tasty these tender, flavorful, Grilled Chicken Strips are. They pair well with all kinds of veggies and starches, and take particularly well to customizing with your favorite sauces and seasonings—we’re partial to tossing them with a bit of Korean Gochujang Sauce, ourselves. They’re a great topper for salads, pastas, and pizzas, phenomenal as a filling for tacos and quesadillas, lovely when layered into sandwiches and wraps, and an easy addition to casseroles and baked enchiladas.\nRead More",

But here in the U.S., Vermont is the place from which the most revered domestic maple syrup comes.\nTrader Joe’s Organic Vermont Grade A Dark Color & Robust Taste Maple Syrup is harvested late in the season, when the sap’s sugar content is lower and water content is higher. The longer boiling period required to create the finished syrup results in the darker color and intense flavor. It’s an impeccable pancake partner, and an ideal ingredient in maple-focused recipes as well.\nRead More",

But break open a ball of Burrata, and you’ll be delighted to discover soft, stretchy curds comingling with rich cream in its center, with a touch of sea salt to balance its slightly sweet, milky aroma. Creamy and almost cloud-like, it’s a cheese-lover’s dream, with only the simplest accompaniment needed to allow it to shine. Looking for palatable partners? How about fresh cantaloupe slices and balsamic vinegar? Perhaps some grilled peaches and mixed greens? Or maybe on pizza, with slow roasted tomatoes and basil, a glug of extra virgin olive oil, and a few cracks of sea salt…\nRead More",

Our most recent venture in finding vegan versions of normally non-vegan fare brought us to a supplier in Greece, who specializes in plant-based cheese alternatives. They made for us this Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend, which combines a variety of vegan cheese alternatives into a single, peppery, plant-based blend. We were intrigued. Then, when we saw how well it melted (a notoriously difficult feat for non-dairy products), we were hooked. We think you’ll be, too. \n \nSavory, spicy, and remarkably creamy, Trader Joe’s Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend is great for any situation that calls for cheese: topping tacos, filling quesadillas, sprinkling over salads—you name it. With its blend of vegan shreds and savory spices, including cayenne, cumin, and dried jalapeño peppers, it brings a pleasant, building heat to any dish it’s added to. While it’s especially suited for Mexican, Tex Mex, or Southwest cuisines, we certainly wouldn’t stop there: try it on a plant-based patty melt with Impossible Burger or a stuffed bell pepper, and you’ll see exactly what we mean.\nRead More",

Already fully cooked, our Thai Vegetable Gyoza easily fulfill your preparation preference – steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone). Serve hot with our Gyoza Dipping Sauce or place atop a bed of greens and dress with simple soy-sesame vinaigrette.\nRead More",

A dairy-defying feat of deliciousness, the oat-based Chocolate is impossibly smooth and creamy, just like milk chocolate—but without milk! Building upon that bodacious base, our buyer worked with the same bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia to develop a crispy counterpart, in the form of Trader Joe’s Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs.\n \nMade with cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 42% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate), the addition of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat “milk”) makes these Bars lusciously—dare we say, ludicrously—creamy. Bite into one of these Bars, however, and you’ll experience a terrific textural transition from magnificently smooth, “I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-milk” chocolate to the delightful crunch of the included Crispy Rice and Cocoa Nibs, along with a touch of sea salt. Like their forebears, these Bars are vegan, soy free, gluten free, and kosher (pareve). They’re also presented as a three-pack of individually wrapped bars for easy, on-the-go enjoyment. In short, they’re some of the best non-dairy chocolate bars we’ve tasted, bar none!\nRead More",

Just like standard spaghetti, the Abruzzese version is long and thin, made with durum wheat semolina and water, but instead of having a rounded shape, this Spaghetti is uniquely square, and goes by the name Spaghetti alla Chitarra.\nRead More",

An ice cream that’s wondrously light, yet velvety and dense.\nTJ’s Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato is made for us by an Italian supplier using more milk than cream, yielding a lower butterfat content than you’d find in American-style ice cream. This gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality while still remaining delectably smooth and creamy, and allows its Chocolate and Vanilla Bean flavors (courtesy of cocoa, semisweet chocolate, and actual vanilla bean specks) and its sweet, chocolate-sauce Swirl to really shine.\nRead More",

It offers the bright tang of yellow mustard, balanced by sweet and smoky molasses, the vibrancy of vinegar, tomato puree & Worcestershire, and a blend of spices, including a kick of cayenne pepper. It's a bit sweeter than the sauces from which it descends, which enhances its versatility.

This leaves a concentrated, protein-rich yogurt low in sodium and sugar, making for a nutritious snack any time of day!\nRead More",

Maybe not to a Hellenic historian, but Trader Joe’s Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt is surely a remarkable construction of classical antiquity to our customers!\nLike Prometheus stole fire from Zeus to gift to the Ancient Grecians, Trader Joe’s brings our Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt from Mount Olympus to mortals all across the United States! At its core, “Greek” yogurt is achieved by simply straining the liquid whey and lactose from “regular” yogurt which leaves behind a tangier, creamier yogurt. Using grade A, pasteurized milk, cream, and live and active cultures, Trader Joe’s Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt simply filters the whey from the yogurt cultures, achieving the characteristically thick texture and high protein goodness found in classic-style strained Greek yogurt.\nRead More",

We’ve taken Sea Salt Potato Chips, Corn Chip Dippers, and Mini Pretzel Nuggets, and crushed them, then we’ve mixed everything with creamy milk chocolate and divided the resulting combination into bite-sized Clusters. The upshot of this innovation is that each bite begins with smooth, sweet chocolate, and is quickly followed by the salted crunch of Chips and Nuggets. Snacking conundrum solved!\nRead More",

        "description": "There’s nothing quite like a big bowl of fresh blueberries in the summertime, but a jar of Trader Joe’s Organic Blueberry Preserves comes pretty close! Our supplier takes wild, organic blueberries, harvested from the Canadian Boreal Forest, and simmers them with organic cane sugar to complement their pleasantly tart and rich blueberry flavor. A bit of pectin is added to lend the sweet, slightly tangy Preserves a bit of body, ensuring supreme spreadability atop your carb of choice (it’s especially good on toasted Braided & Sliced Brioche). Take an unexpected turn into savory territory by mixing some Preserves with an equal amount of chopped Hot & Sweet Jalapeños and showcase the resulting relish on a turkey burger—the fruity & sweet-meets-heat vibe is irresistible. And of course, it’d be right at home as the “J” in a PB&J sandwich.\nRead More",

Spinach may not be hip or trendy, but it’s a stalwart standby that always lives up to expectations. Cultivated stateside since the early 19th century, spinach had been a European staple for a thousand years before that. It was in the 20th century that spinach first got its “superfood” status – from a comic strip character, no less! And while it was silly when Popeye’s muscles suddenly bulged after eating a can of spinach, there was also, in fact, some truth to that story.\nRead More",

It tastes like lentils! It eats, though, like pasta, and if you cook it according to the package directions (for about 5-6 minutes in boiling water), its texture is exactly al dente. Nutritionally-speaking, what this legume-based pasta offers is almost astonishing. Made with a single ingredient (organic red lentil flour), our Sedanini is packed with 13 grams of protein in every serving. That’s impressive. And delicious. Pair it with our Organic Tomato Basil Marinara or a simple blend of olive oil, garlic, and grated cheese.

When mixed together, as they often are in dishes like paella, chili, and shakshua, they express the whole of the pepper’s potential.

In addition to its status as the best-selling style of salad dressing in the U.S. for over three decades, it’s also earned the title of best-selling condiment in the U.S. in recent years—even more so than ketchup! Beloved for how well its creamy, herby flavor profile enhances French fries, carrot sticks, chicken wings, pizza, and everything in between, ranch is a powerhouse of “put-it-on-everything” practicality, and Trader Joe’s Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ably demonstrates why.\nRead More",

A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain.

This is Chokanan mango, grown in Thailand, where it is harvested at the peak of ripeness, then peeled and sliced into strips (it’s the same type of mango you’ll find in our Chile Spiced Mango). The drying process is unique in that it uses vegetable-based glycerin to keep the mango soft – but never mushy – and mango juice is added in to give it a little extra moisture and further intensify the mango flavor.\nRead More",

        "description": "A few years ago, we introduced a baked treat that dared to ask, “if you love brownies, and you love chocolate chip cookies, why not enjoy both at the same time?”. The Brookie was an instant hit, and its dual- layered approach to dessert continues to be a consummate customer favorite to this day. So much so, in fact, that we felt the time was right to bring in another delectable doubleheader onto our shelves. Made for us by the same supplier as the adored original, Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Brookie takes the Brookie formula into a wonderfully nutty new direction.\nRead More",

        "description": "Since their invention nearly sixty years ago, Buffalo wings have soared to auspicious heights within the world of appetizers—it’s difficult to imagine what modern American bar food would look like without them. In fact, they’re so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken- based counterparts. And while we’ve enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they’ve always felt different than a traditional Buffalo wing—delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category. With this in mind, we recently reached out to one of our suppliers, an expert in plant-based proteins, and gave them this challenge: a vegan, Buffalo-style appetizer that truly captures the feeling of a crisp, fresh-from-the-fryer Buffalo wing. They proudly came back with Trader Joe’s Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.\nRead More",

Before you say, “Duh, Trader Joe’s,” allow us to explain…\nAll of our Organic Peanut Butters are made with Valencia peanuts, grown only in Texas and New Mexico. In contrast, most commercial peanut butters are made from Runner peanuts. Runners are widely cultivated and have a high yield, but they’re just not as good tasting as Valencias. That’s because Valencias are naturally sweet with an intense peanut flavor—eliminating the need to add any kind of sweeteners or flavor enhancers. Valen- cias are so good, we use only two ingredients to make our Organic Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter... You guessed it: peanuts and salt. Really, we think once you taste ours, you’ll wonder how you ever got through this much of your life without it.\nRead More",

Kale, shredded tofu, and edamame add fresh and vibrant flavors to our rolls.

Fold it in to chicken or egg salad, slather it on a sandwich, or blend it into your favorite dip recipe.\nRead More",

After all, we don’t have anywhere near that number of total products in our stores!\nYou will, however, see a terrific value on Jasmine Rice from Thailand, where it is known as hom mali. Also known as “fragrant rice,” Jasmine Rice is a curved, long-grain rice with a subtle, jasmine-like fragrance and soft, nutty flavor. It’s simple to prepare – 20 minutes or so on your stovetop or in a rice cooker yields soft, fluffy, full-flavored rice. Serve it as a side dish, add it to soups, use it to make fried rice or cook it with Coconut Milk instead of water to make a richly flavored dish that will complement an array of main courses.\nRead More",

We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor and adds a soft texture to the mix. The real magic here lies in the creamy, elote-inspired dressing that’s a little tart and a little sweet, with hints of jalapeño and lime. Tossed together, you won’t think you’re eating elote from a street vendor, but you will feel that same energy in every forkful of greens. Add your favorite protein (we like chicken or shrimp) and a sliced avocado to make this a complete meal. Grab a corn tortilla and heat it ever so slightly, then fill it with this satisfying mix—a taco to remember, for sure! If you’re entertaining a crowd, spoon some into Elote Corn Chip Dippers and serve as bite-sized appetizers.\nRead More",

In our stores, you can get Trader Joe’s mango-flavored yogurt, tea, candy... We even sell Mango-scented Shave Cream—although we sincerely hope customers love that one for the scent, not the taste!\nBeyond a good shave, one of our favorite ways to enjoy mango is snacking on Trader Joe’s Organic Dried Mango. It’s grown in a region of Mexico where the climate promotes high-brix fruit. (Brix is a unit used for measuring sweetness.) Our supplier takes these naturally sugary mangoes and washes, peels, and slices them by hand before placing the thin, orange slabs on drying racks. Once dehydrated, the mangoes are hand-sorted to remove the less-attractive pieces, and finally packed into our very attractive, see-through packages. That’s it!\nRead More",

Ours falls in the medium-spicy range—the dish will taste substantially hotter if you actually eat the chili pieces, and a little less hot if you push the chilies to the side of the plate and treat them as a garnish. We think the heat level in our sauce makes it easy to share among friends who fall on opposite sides of the spicy spectrum. If really spicy is your thing, though, you can always add your favorite spicy condiment and even more chili peppers to the finished dish.\nRead More",

So, he would coat chicken pieces with yogurt, skewer them and place them in the tandoor...Tandoori Chicken came to be. Butter, here is where it gets better. To avoid letting leftover tandoori chicken get dry, he crafted a rich, silky (thank you, butter) tomato- and onion-based sauce with which he could enliven the meat, and thus was born the beloved Butter Chicken.\nRead More",

To understand what we mean, just give Trader Joe’s Organic Brown Rice Cake Thins a try...\nFor starters, these are square instead of round. They’re also quite thin, as their name would imply. But despite their thinness, they are rather dense, so they still supply a satisfying crunch. Made simply of puffed organic brown rice with a light sprinkling of sea salt, Organic Brown Rice Cake Thins are an excellent snack choice. Each serving (six Thins!) is just 110 calories, with 1g fat and 0g sugar. They’re gluten free and kosher, too!\nRead More",

During the holidays, they’re a great option for featuring in a classic green bean casserole, and can be pickled, blanched, or deep-fried any other time of year. For a quick, elevated veggie dish, give them a light steam before sautéeing in olive oil with lemon zest, salt, and pepper, then top with Shaved Parmiggiano Reggiano.\nRead More",

Fresh, right-off-the-tree olives are full of an extremely bitter-tasting compound called oleuropein, which can be removed by submerging them in various kinds of solutions, or even just packing them in salt, for an extended period of time. In some cases, olive farmers prefer to “crack” their olives prior to curing, by smashing them just enough to allow the pit to be removed. These cracked olives, or olive schiacciate, as they’re known in Italy, absorb more brine than an intact olive as they cure, developing a deeper flavor and softer texture. And when combined with a mix of pickled veggies, capers, and savory seasonings, as they are in Trader Joe’s Cracked Olive Salad, they’re nothing short of a cracking good time.\nRead More",

The crisped side proved to be quite pleasing.\nWe love good food stories as much as we love good dumplings, so once upon a time, we developed our very own Chicken Gyoza Potstickers. These crescent-shaped dumplings are made from wheat flour wrappers that enfold a flavorful filling of chicken, cabbage and onion, seasoned with soy sauce, sesame seed oil and ginger powder. Already fully cooked, our Chicken Gyoza Potstickers easily fulfill your preparation preference – steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone). Serve hot with our Gyoza Dipping Sauce or place atop a bed of greens and dress with simple soy-sesame vinaigrette.\nRead More",

The fact that we very much need it for our brains and bodies to function properly aside, salt is essential in preserving food, in killing foodborne pathogens, and in allowing the flavor receptors on our tongues to fully perceive sweet, sour, and umami tastes. Across time and countless cultures, salt has held immeasurable social, economic, and religious importance, and provided the etymological inspiration for words like sauce, sausage,  salad, salacious, and salary (among many others). All this to say: salt is pretty darn important! So it might as well be easy to work with, like it is with Trader Joe’s Sea Salt Crystals.\n \nMade with hefty-sized sea salt crystals sourced from South Africa, our Sea Salt comes in a jar with a convenient grinder already attached. Which means that all it takes to add just the right amount of salt to any kind of dish is a couple of satisfyingly crackly spins of the lid. Since it’s such a crucial part of any pantry, we’re proud to say that our Sea Salt is of dependably excellent quality, and sells for an equally excellent everyday price.\nRead More",

They add much-needed body and texture to crab cakes, meatballs, and salmon patties, a delightfully crispy pop of texture when used to top baked mac and cheese, and make a superlatively delicious breading for pork cutlets, chicken cordon bleu, or air-fried pickles.

Here’s why: Shishito Peppers are enormously delicious and a bit daring, couldn’t be simpler to prepare, are famously finger-friendly, and make perfect appetizers.\nNative to Japan (perhaps via Portugal, some speculate), the slender, green peppers have delicate skin and a slightly pleated surface that makes for a fresh crunch raw or a tender bite cooked. They have a whisper of grassy and peppery flavor, with a faint note of citrus. And—here’s the kicker—some (approximately one in ten) have a real kick! So popping peppers is a bit roulette-y: mild, mild, mild, POW!... The hit of heat and suspense are addicting.\nRead More",

Something like “Pinnie-the-Wooh” sound familiar?\nOh, how he would adore Trader Joe’s Multi-Floral and Clover Honey... so do we, and you will too! It’s luscious, mildly sweet and amber-colored honey. We used to call this stuff simply “Clover Honey,” but the bees can pollinate & forage the nectar of whatever plants they choose. So, on account of the fact that a different species of flora could lure the bees out of their beloved clover fields from time to time, we’ve added “Multi-Floral” to its moniker. It’s in a classic 12-ounce squeezable bear, so cute you just want to squeeze ‘em.\nRead More",

An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a satisfyingly toothsome texture).

Unlike your everyday pretzel, however, their increased surface area allows them to be used as a vehicle for a wide variety of dips, cheeses, spreads — even salsas, if you so choose — meaning these Pretzel Slims aren’t just delicious, they’re postively practical.\nRead More",

After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick crème fraîche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+.\nRead More",

As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that’s outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, a natural with melon for brunch or hors d’oeuvres and super on a pizza – try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus.\nRead More",

Bok choy is a cruciferous vegetable (a relative of cabbage) that’s loaded with vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate and calcium. Unique to bok choy among its peers, interestingly, is the bioavailability of its calcium (how much can actually be absorbed by the human body). A full 54% of bok choy’s calcium can be absorbed by the body. By way of comparison, the figure for spinach, a very healthy green, is just five percent. It’s even higher than milk, which comes in at 32%.\n\nYou can use Baby Bok Choy in soups and stir-frys, salads and side dishes. Slice it into long strips for stir-fry, blend it into a chopped salad, or sauté it in a bit of olive oil and garlic for a slightly sweet, crisp veggie side that will enliven any meal.

Though it has no historical relation to the real General Tsao Tsung-T’ang, a 19th century military leader from Hunan and prominent figure in the Taiping Rebellion, it’s likely it was named in his honor as a nod to its creator’s Hunan roots, and specialization in Hunanese cuisine. In turn, Trader Joe’s General Tsao Stir Fry Sauce is a nod to this sweet and lightly spicy comfort food favorite, bringing you the same bright flavors and satisfying heat that have delighted diners on crispy chicken for nearly 50 years.\n\nIndeed, our General Tsao Sauce is quite delicious when served over battered and fried chicken, but that’s just a starting point. It also makes a great base for stir fries of all kinds, an excellent dipping sauce with dumplings or crispy veggies, and a phenomenal marinade for pork, poultry, beef, or fish. For a quick, easy, and sweetly spicy side, simply toss some steamed broccoli or cauliflower with a few tablespoons of this Sauce and serve. Delicious!\nRead More",

        "description": "Did you know? Greek yogurt isn’t specifically “Greek”, per se—it simply has that reputation due to the fact that a yogurt company with origins in Greece was one of the first to introduce yogurt to the U.S. that had most of its liquid strained out (called straggisto in Greece). While not solely a Greek invention, this technique is certainly popular in Greece, and elsewhere around the globe, since the straining process leaves it with its signature tangy yogurt flavor, but a texture closer to that of sour cream.\n\nAll that said: we love Greek yogurt. The tang! The texture! And we know you love it, too, because we sell more Greek style yogurt than you can shake a strainer at. Trader Joe’s Greek Yogurts are made for us by a “yogurteria” that scores big on tang, texture, and of course, value!\n\nOur Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt is made, as one might expect, using whole milk, so it’s a “full fat” yogurt. Its rich flavor and thick, yet smooth, consistency are ideal complements to the inherent tanginess of Greek style yogurt. It’s luscious, flavorful, and creamy, high in protein (7-10 grams per serving, depending on flavor), and contain cultures like L. Bulgaricus, L. Acidophilus, and Bifidus to aid in healthy digestion.\nRead More",

When that’s our craving, we reach for Trader Joe’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt.\n\nTrader Joe’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is a standout in the creaminess department – creaminess you expect from the best Greek yogurts – and is made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. Some “Greek-style” yogurts come by their creaminess via thickeners or gums. Not this one. TJ’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is strained, as tradition dictates, to remove much of the liquid whey, leaving a thicker, creamier yogurt.\n\nOur Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is also higher in protein than classic, European-style yogurts – each eight ounce serving has 22 grams of protein! Add in some fresh or frozen fruit and a little granola for a hearty breakfast. Add a bit of honey for a satisfying snack. Blend into a smoothie to add a touch of tartness to that sweet treat. Or use it in place of sour cream on tacos or baked potatoes.\nRead More",

Well, thanks to a palatable new pepper offering, we’ve decided to reword it. “Trader Joe’s picked a peck of Hot & Sweet Jalapeños…” Sounds rather catchy, we think.\nThe developers of our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños originally came upon a jar of candied jalapeños in Kansas City, Missouri. The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement—but not overpower—the heat of the jalapeños. And, yes, these are spicy; they’ll certainly pack the punch you’d expect from the small but mighty jalapeño. Grown in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalapeños are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalapeño puree, garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled—and sweet—pepper.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings is based on a traditional South Asian recipe that’s been celebrated in the Indian region for five centuries. And, it’s made with ingredients that have been enjoyed for thousands of years!\nRead More",

The Russets you’ll find at Trader Joe’s are definitely delicious, and they also happen to be loaded with potassium and fiber. They’re also practically a perfect size for baking (we recommend giving them a light coat of oil and salt before placing in the oven at 350°F for an hour), at about 4-5 inches and only about 100 calories each. (Disclaimer: if you add loads of butter, sour cream and bacon to your potatoes, we cannot be held responsible for the ultimate calorie count.)\n\nOf course, you don’t have to stick with baking and mashing your Russet Potatoes. You can grate them and make quick hash browns, purée them to thicken soups or slice them, toss them in olive oil, and heat them in an air fryer to make healthy “fries.”\nRead More",

True to form, Trader Joe’s Organic Hickory Smoked Turkey Breast is superb for sandwiches, but its laudable attributes go far beyond the fact that it’s conveniently pre-sliced. Our Organic Turkey Breast is sourced from turkeys that are allowed plenty of space to roam about, and are never fed animal by-products; just a strict, vegetarian diet. And they’re also never given antibiotics, or added hormones. We could stop there... but we won’t! Each thinly sliced piece of Turkey is tender, savory, and has a delicate Hickory smokiness to it that pairs especially well with a nice, sharp Cheddar—like our Organic New Zealand Cheddar, for instance—and even better when that pairing comes together in the form of a warm turkey melt.\nRead More",

By “a base of sweet corn,” we mean, “lots and lots of sweet corn.” As in, 1.8 ears of corn in every jar – we have taken them off their cobs to make them fit. (We’ve sold enough of this salsa that over time, this has added up to more than 41,313,173 ears of corn.) It has a little kick, but it’s not what we’d call hot.\nRead More",

That’s where the similarities end, and ours takes a turn for the better. Our Bread’s recipe also includes sorghum (in the grass family, cultivated for grain) and potato flours, ingredients that help give our bread a softer, fluffier texture and milder, more familiar flavor than the name brand.

They then bake them to a perfectly pleasing soft texture, which not only interacts wonderfully with the crunch of the seeds, but accentuates its interplay of sweet and savory flavors, too.\nRead More",

It’s made from a simple mixture that includes cream, milk, sugar, egg yolks, some peppermint extract and chocolatey fudge chips. And notice that Super Premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, which in ice cream terms, refers to the amount of air mixed into the final product. That means that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe’s Mint Chip Ice Cream has 26% overrun—in other words, it’s a delightfully dense, super Super Premium Ice Cream!\nRead More",

        "description": "The popular Latin American beverage called horchata [or-cha-ta] is creamy and sweet, like ice cream. With no good excuse not to, we decided to take it all the way there—from smooth beverage to frozen dessert! Trader Joe’s Horchata Inspired Ice Cream delivers all the delicious flavors of horchata in every spoonful.\nLike many ice creams, its rich base includes cream, milk, egg yolks, and cane sugar. We horchatized it by adding cinnamon and brown rice flour, plus a touch of sea salt. And since inclusions are fun, we also added pieces of horchata-flavored cookies, contributing a nice textural variation.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Sliced Provolone Cheese makes this exemplar cheese variety available in a pre-sliced form ready to enjoy atop sandwiches, wraps, and other cold cut classics a plenty.\nA cousin of mozzarella, Provolone Cheese is a cow’s milk, semi-hard formaggi a pasta filata (Italian for “spun paste cheese”). It undergoes kneading of the fresh curd in hot water to give that famously elastic, rubbery texture that Provolone Cheese is known for. This mass of curd created from the stretching process is then aged to harden, and therefore differentiate, the Provolone from its mozzarella cousin. Like all pulled curd cheeses, a bit of Sliced Provolone Cheese is wonderful, and arguably more flavorful, when melted. This should direct your mind to the world of paninis, casseroles, baked pasta, and hoagies as a perfect pairing for our Sliced Provolone Cheese. Each slice was made for two slices of fresh bread, to be flashed in heat, and to evoke images of ooey gooey goodness.\nRead More",

        "description": "Trader Joe's BBQ Cut Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets with Skin are from salmon that have been carefully raised in some of the world's most pristine salmon farms, at the foot of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Norway. The salmon are raised with care by experienced fish farmers and never given antibiotics in their feed, which you'll find at some fish farms. Norway's frigid waters make for tender, buttery, and well-marbled salmon-after all, fish need fat to keep warm! Thanks to their extra thick, skin-on \"BBQ Cut,\" these Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets can really take the heat, and are ideal for grilling, pan-searing, roasting, baking, or poaching. They're great to have on hand for protein-and-omega-rich dinners in a hurry. Simply brush the fish with a bit of olive oil or butter, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, and cook as desired. Depending on how fancy you want to get here, dinner can be ready in as little as 15 minutes.\nRead More",

        "description": "People often turn to salads for delicate flavors. But there’s no rule that says a salad can’t contain bold flavors. In fact, if there were such a rule, Trader Joe’s BBQ & Black Pepper Toscano Chopped Salad would be the ultimate rule-breaker!\nThis is a complete salad kit, containing everything you need to construct a crisp, fresh—and particularly bold— salad. The base includes green and red cabbages, combined with shredded carrots, broccoli, and kale. Such confident vegetable crunchiness is complemented by even more crunch, conveyed by cornbread croutons. The addition of aged, Black Pepper Toscano Cheese (packaged separately) brings another kind of boldness to this Salad—a rich and nutty flavor, with a touch of cracked black pepper heat.\nRead More",

Sounds dramatic, but that’s really how long it takes for an Ananas comosus plant to grow this spiky, juicy, yellow-fleshed fruit, which—fun fact—is technically 100-200 fused “fruitlets.” You know what they say: all good things take time. And Pineapples are most certainly good things.\nFinding the perfect pineapple can be a bit of a treasure hunt, but at Trader Joe’s, you’ll strike gold every time. Grown for us in Costa Rica, our Pineapples are harvested at peak ripeness, when the golden fruit is heavy with bright, sweet-tart juice. To really unlock your Pineapple’s potential, peel it, core it, and slice it into rounds, spears, or chunks. Serve those slices alone or in a fruit salad, a smoothie, a cocktail, or a cup of yogurt. Pineapple also happens to be one of those fruits that’s delicious both fresh and cooked, so don’t be afraid to grill or broil those slices. zeven add them to a pizza—never mind the naysayers!\nRead More",

Here, instead of chocolate chips, you’ll find a power- trio of blanched peanuts, dry roasted peanuts, and peanut butter. This triple peanutty perspective is concocted with the usual cookie-recipe suspects (sugar, flour, eggs, etc.), including salted butter, which brings with it a richness, a smoothness, a...buttery-ness.\nRead More",

The result is a snack that has a certain air of sophistication to it, but still stays true to its fun, familiar origins.\nRead More",

The fish are fully skinned and deboned, then gently seasoned with such goodies as mirepoix—the classic combination of carrots, celery and onions—and sea salt. They are formed into patties and quick frozen—this locks in moisture and super salmon flavor, resulting in a truly sensational, mild-tasting (read: never fishy), flaky burger. You don’t even need to thaw them; you can grill them from frozen with excellent results. No grill? No problem. Cook them in the oven or on the stovetop with equal ease. Serve them on buns with all the traditional burger accouterments, crumbled over a garden salad, or as center-of-the-plate for a protein-packed repast.\nRead More",

Though its precise origins are somewhat disputed, food historians generally agree that it rose to prominence as part of Argentinian ranch cuisine, likely sometime in the 19th century, primarily as a way to season grilled beef. Since then, as Trader Joe’s Chimichurri Sauce deftly demonstrates, its uses have expanded to include sandwiches and seafood, burgers and kebabs, pastas and potatoes — pretty much anything that’s savory and delicious will be even more so with a bit of Chimichurri on top.\n\nStarting with a mix of finely chopped parsley and cilantro, our supplier adds in minced garlic, dried cumin, and crushed red pepper, then blends in a mix of oil and vinegar. The resulting Sauce is a compellingly complex mix of herby aromatics, savory spice, silky texture, and even a delicately tart note that serves to wake up the flavors within any entrée it’s added to. We especially like it with grilled shrimp on crispy crostini, al pastor tacos with charred pineapple, roasted sweet potatoes with crumbled cotija, or, of course, a freshly seared steak.\nRead More",

        "description": "Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as elote. While the fixins may vary from vendor to vendor, elotes typically come slathered in mayo or a crema-based sauce, rolled in grated cotija or añejo cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero (or making elotes at home) can tell you, it’s a highly craveable combination of flavors that’s sure to leave an impression. It’s left such an impression on us, in fact, that it inspired our exclusive-to-TJ’s snack: Trader Joe’s Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers.\nRead More",

These bite-sized crackers are made with whole wheat flour and rolled oats, then cut in squares – and the best part – they’re topped with garlic, onion, sesame, poppy and caraway seeds.

Drizzle it over eggs for breakfast or employ it as a replacement for traditional enchilada sauce in an enchilada bake at dinnertime. Of course, chips are improved with a dip in this salsa (hey, “salsa” is just Spanish for “sauce,” so even though it’s not a salsa, per se, it is technically still a salsa), and its ever-slightly-sweet overtones are delicious with tacos.\nRead More",

First, we recommend scooping it out, placing it in a freezer-safe sandwich bag, then squeezing as much air out as you can before sealing and placing in the freezer. You can use the rest, bit by bit, for enhancing the flavor of practically any dish that uses ground meat (or plant-based alternatives), or for making quick, homemade ketchups, BBQ sauces, and even Bloody Mary mixes.\nRead More",

Made from soybeans, brown rice, barley, and millet, our Organic 3 Grain Tempeh is a nutritional powerhouse full of fibrous grains and plant-based protein. Basically, we take the aforementioned ingredients, partially cook them, then inoculate the mixture with a culture that ferments the blend.

Form it into patties and serve with all the classic burger fixings. Cook up a pot of chicken chili. Use it as the key ingredient for casseroles, pot pies, meatballs, meatloaf, lettuce wraps, tacos, pasta sauces, chicken stuffed peppers… Okay, you get the idea. When we say versatile, we do mean versatile.\nRead More",

        "description": "Consider, for a moment, the crouton. Perhaps you haven’t given croutons much thought in the past — an entirely understandable position to be in, given that they’re hardly ever the focus of a meal. As purveyors (and appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe’s Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born.\nRead More",

Seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine, as well as some sugar, onions, seaweed, salt, and sesame oil – the medley offers rich, rounded flavor. Because the rice has already been cooked, it requires only a simple heating. A couple minutes in the microwave returns fluffy, tender grains, while a handful of minutes in a frying pan or wok (over medium heat) browns the grains and gives them a craveable crispness. Delicious on its own, Vegetable Fried Rice is also a welcoming base for more veggies, fried tofu, TJ’s Mandarin Orange Chicken or TJ’s Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef and Broccoli.\nRead More",

Making them from scratch, however, is not always an option—so what’s a muffin maven to do? Keep a box of Trader Joe’s Blueberry Muffin Mix on hand, that’s what!\nThis masterful Mix brings you that much closer to a fresh batch of Blueberry Muffins, offering consistent, from-scratch flavor without all the measuring the from-scratch process usually entails. After countless trials of careful taste-testing (a tough job, we know), the tasting panel determined that freeze-dried Blueberries, when rehydrated and stirred into the batter, were far superior in flavor and texture than regular dried blueberries in the finished Muffins, and almost indistinguishable from their fresh counterparts—so we’ve included them in the box! You supply the refrigerated staples (butter, eggs, and milk or non-dairy beverage of choice), apply a bit of elbow grease, and you’ll end up with 12, generously-sized, enjoyably sweet Blueberry Muffins, with a tender crumb that’s studded with plenty of blueberries throughout. Keep a box on hand for breakfast, brunch, and snacks (oh my!), and you’ll never be caught unawares when the craving strikes!\nRead More",

Inside, it’s an almond butter abondanza. Really. More than 35% of the recipe here is almond butter, made from almonds grown in California’s Central Valley. Like their PBP (that’s Peanut Butter Pretzel) cousins, every bite is crunchy (outside) and creamy (inside); salty (outside) and a little sweet (inside). This makes them a particularly satisfying solo snack, and a likewise excellent addition to your favorite TJ’s trail mix—you won’t regret keeping a bag in your desk drawer or backpack for either purpose. And if you’re looking for a pairing partner, a crisp lager, hot tea, or cold glass of lemonade will do the trick.\nRead More",

        "description": "Hummus, simply meaning “chickpeas” in Arabic, is a staple of the Trader Joe’s fresh dip refrigerators. While we love to toy with the classic chickpea-based spread and make funky, creative additions, none are more pure than a newly opened container of Trader Joe’s Organic Hummus.\nOur supplier starts with the star of the show: our favorite nutty legume, the chickpea, and blends it into an incredibly creamy base for its supporting acts. A couple spoonfuls of sesame tahini, a splash of oils, garlic and lemon to add tang to the sweet chickpea blend, and salt and cumin round out the pure, organic ingredient list. Don’t allow the unassuming, beige dip basking in its re-sealable bowl fool you, Trader Joe’s Organic Hummus is a classic that is far more than the sum of its parts. This proprietary blend of these age-old ingredients has us salivating for that next dollop of Organic Hummus. So much so that we may just double dip when no one’s peekin’!\nRead More",

A classic combination, not unlike a bountiful blend of garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.\nBut what makes our traditional hummus different? First, consistency. Mediterranean Hummus is super smooth and creamy, a bit more “whipped” than many of our other hummus choices. The texture of hummus tends to be different depending on where in the world it originates, so it makes sense for us to offer some of that variety in our stores. We’ve also taken the liberty of topping Trader Joe’s Mediterranean Hummus with crunchy pine nuts, and a bright blend of parsley, red bell pepper, and olive oil which creates a distinctive flavor and texture profile we think you’ll really enjoy. Of course, it’s also mighty delicious – then again, this isn’t a difference at all, because we think all of our hummus options (hummi?) are delicious.\nRead More",

Establishing the foundation for this classic dish is our marinated, BBQ dark chicken meat.

        "description": "Similar to the jars of chili oil with crunchy garlic you can find on the table of many Chinese restaurants, the genius of Chili Onion Crunch is in its simplicity: with just a handful of simple ingredients, it creates a remarkably deep flavor profile that manages to accentuate the flavors of anything else it’s placed on. The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the olive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all the other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning.\nRead More",

And thanks to the bit of buttermilk and spoonful or two of sour cream in the batter, the finished product is mega-moist and extra fluffy.

When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, the allicin within fresh garlic — i.e., the chemical that gives garlic its uniquely pungent flavor and aroma — begins to break down into S-allylcysteine, a compound that turns the whitish garlic cloves black, softens them, and converts their distinctly garlicky flavor into something sweeter, richer, and more complex.

        "description": "Lighter and creamier in consistency than their Russet cousins, our Organic Gold Potatoes make an excellent choice for mashing, roasting, and slicing thin for gratins all year round. They’re especially well-suited for big holiday meals. In addition to the aesthetic quality of their pale, golden-hued flesh, their skin takes on a softer texture when cooked, making it easier to manage when making rustic skin-on mashed potatoes. Gold Potatoes also crisp up wonderfully when quartered and roasted with a bit of olive oil and minced garlic, and they make a great addition to soups, stews, or curries. Would it be redundant of us to say these Potatoes are good as Gold?\nRead More",

At her age, she explained, she wanted to take life one banana at a time. Well, we listened, and that’s why Trader Joe’s sells bananas one banana at a time.

It’s crafted for us by a family-owned company that’s been making pasta for more than 100 years. First, they mill durum wheat into golden semolina flour, add the purest water from the Madonie wildlife reserve, and begin the mixing. Then, once it reaches the right consistency, the dough is pushed through the proper pasta die, and the completed Capellini is left to dry. Our supplier’s attention to craft and commitment to technology results in consistent, quality Capellini every time.\nRead More",

It can be served with just a little olive oil, but becomes especially tasty when traditionally plated with a simple pesto to coat each elliptical noodle as you spin a bit onto your fork. Other common taste-elavating options include using tomato-based sauces or a light sauce with a seafood addition - think salmon, cod, or shrimp. In as little as 7 to 8 minutes of passively boiling pasta, you can have yourself a plate of Italian Linguine noodles, toothsomely al dente, of course, and you’ll be sending your tastebuds on a flavorful flight 6,000 miles across the Atlantic to our favorite boot shaped nation!\nRead More",

        "description": "A long-favored fixture of winter festivals in the Netherlands, poffertjes are light, puffy, miniature pancakes that are traditionally served with a bit of butter and powdered sugar. They’re typically made from a simple recipe of sweet, yeasted batter, but require a highly specialized skillet called a poffertjespan to attain their perfectly snackable, one-or-two-bite size. In the spirit of foodie festivity, and in recognition of the fact that most of us don’t have a spare poffertjespan lying around, we’re offering Trader Joe’s Maple Flavored Poffertjes this holiday season to keep spirits bright, hearts warm, and breakfasts sweet and satisfying.\nRead More",

The other half of what you need to know is that these veggies are partnered with glass noodles made from sweet potato and lightly seasoned with soy sauce. True to their name, these noodles are semi-translucent, with a soft, pleasantly chewy texture.\nRead More",

Trader Joe’s Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches came to fruition some years back, when we had an ice cream epiphany and realized we could do better—way better—than most of the ice cream sandwiches we found in freezers around the country. Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. (Yes, it’s a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they’d been frozen), we moved on to the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips. In case you were curious, this is the kind of task we can always be counted on to undertake with vigilance.\nRead More",

You can also microwave the sauce and toss it with the chicken, but we think the little bit of extra effort pays off handsomely.

With more than 40 years of traditional cheese making experience, a famed farm on this estate transforms rich, creamy milk from local grazing herds (within a 30 mile radius) into beautiful, full-bodied farmhouse Cheddar. Inspired by a classically British ploughman’s lunch pairing (cheese & chutney), these blending artists mix caramelized onion marmalade into the Cheddar, giving it a balanced sweet-savory bite and pleasing onion aroma. It’s firm, creamy and adorned throughout with bits of onion. It’s memorable!\nRead More",

Smoothed with milk and butter, the cheeses melt to blanket the elbows beautifully – though, a quick stir can seriously spread the gooey-d-ness.

        "description": "Some foods have a long history. Few, though, can be traced back to the last ice age. Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange, however, is so deeply rooted in the land, that the only way to completely understand it is to go back just that far. What is now northwestern Wisconsin was once barren land covered with glaciers. As the glaciers melted, they left behind a countryside of rolling hills and pasturelands, pasturelands that now serve as the main diet of the cows that produce the milk used to craft Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange. So, when you think about it, it all goes back to the glaciers. People talk about terroir in relation to wines: this brief history is testimony to the fact that it can be just as appropriate in describing certain cheeses. The history of Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange at Trader Joe’s isn’t quite as ancient as the glaciers, but we have featured it in our cheese case for more than a decade. (If you’ve ever wept over the loss of a favorite product, you’ll know this is a lifetime in Trader Joe’s years!) It’s a unique combination of Cheddar flavor and Gruyere creaminess; buttery & nutty, with a sweet, mild finish. This Cheese crafted just for us by a Wisconsin Master Cheesemaker and aged 90 days to achieve its distinctive taste and texture. Try it on a burger, in a grilled cheese sandwich, or cut into chunks on a cheese tray.\nRead More",

        "description": "With a mild climate, rich soil, and abundant sunshine, it should be no surprise that California’s Central Valley is an ideal place to grow a large chunk of the world’s premium almonds.

Trader Joe’s Raw Almonds are of the supreme grade, nonpareil variety. French for “no equal”, nonpareil almonds are prized for their uniform shape and size, their versatility, and their consistently crunchy texture. And, these Raw Almonds have more than just a crunchy flavorful snack hiding under their shells: Trader Joe’s Raw Almonds are teeming with terrific dietary benefits such as heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, protein; and minerals such as calcium, iron, and potassium in every serving.

The delicate texture of the soft, creamy lemon layer instantly gives way to the dense, deliciously crumbly shortbread base, giving you all the satisfaction of a sweet custard and a rich, buttery biscuit all at the same time. Of course, we also love that they’re super easy to prepare; simply defrost them at room temperature for about an hour before serving. And we can’t forget that they’re a remarkable value, too. There’s so many things to love about our new, vegetarian, kosher (dairy) Classic Lemon Bars, we really could go on, but that might be time better spent enjoying a Bar with a nice cup of coffee. Mmm - Classic.\nRead More",

Frankly, our customers weren’t as excited about either version. We think the main problem is hazelnuts. No offense to hazelnuts, but they taste too much like… hazelnuts. Knowing that there was likely a better nut-butter and cocoa combination to be had, we went to work tasting: peanut butter with chocolate; chocolate with cashew butter… It wasn’t until we got to almonds that we realized we had the makings of a winner! Trader Joe’s Cocoa Almond Spread is made with a creamy nut-butter made from California almonds. We blend this familiar and favored nut flavor with Belgian cocoa to create a creamy, chocolately, almondy spread. As you might have guessed, this version has been a supreme success since its debut in 2011. Whether you put it on pancakes, scoop it with apple slices, or spread it on a sandwich, we believe you’ll agree our Cocoa Almond Spread is a tried-and-true taste sensation!\nRead More",

We’re glad you asked. First, these cookies will absolutely remain in their package—at rest—until acted upon by an outside force, such as, say, your dessert-desiring hand. Second, it’s absolutely true that it takes more force to lift an entire ten-ounce package of Fig Cookies than it does to lift a single Fig Cookie. And that third law? Well, every time you take a Fig Cookie into your mouth, a signal is sent from your taste buds to your brain, and suddenly, your cookie-eating action is met with an equal and opposite reaction… like the sudden impulse to take a second cookie.\nRead More",

There are a few theories as to why: some argue that it's a tendency for higher gluten content, some point to a mastery of fermentation techniques, others tie it to various intangible qualities of local ingredients. Whatever the cause, it's all academic unless you have the chance to visit France. But that got us thinking: why not bring France to our freezers? Thus, we bring to you Trader Joe's Mini French Baguettes, a collection of six compact, individual baguettes, made especially for us by a French bakery, which are baked to about 80% doneness, then frozen for you to finish at home. And that means one thing in particular: ineffably French, perfectly baked Baguettes, fresh from your very own oven.\nRead More",

By the early 1920s, the workers’ strikes had won important reforms, including strict limitations on long and grueling work hours.\nUnder the new laws, French bakeries were forbidden to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Un- fortunately, well-rested bakers also meant that traditional French boules (round loaves) would not have enough time to bake before breakfast. Some historians suspect that this turn of events gave rise to the popularity of the baguette—a long, thin loaf with a shorter baking time—a shoo-in for the new breakfast-bread favorite among the French.\nRead More",

You’ve also inspired Trader Joe’s Italian Truffle Cheese, which is definitely dear because it is good. Our Italian Truffle Cheese is made with black truffles from central Italy’s Umbria region. Made from pasteurized cow’s milk, it’s a young cheese, aged for 15 days. Its mild flavor makes it the ideal canvas for the concentrated truffle oil and black truffle pieces that are blended liberally throughout the cheese. The truffles’ earthy, woody, musky aroma shines, and on the palate, it delivers with aplomb. The semi-soft nature makes this an excellent melting cheese – it’s delicious melted over roasted meats, makes delightful omelets, and adds dynamic dimension to pasta or potato dishes. It also makes a bold statement on a cheese board.\nRead More",

One might say, then, that Girasoli is the pasta of summer.\nWe thought a summer pasta sounded sensational and wanted our Girasloli to capture the radiance and warmth of its namesake. We turned to our revered Italian pasta makers for a recipe. Committed to preserving regional culinary traditions, they presented us with a fine Ricotta & Lemon Zest Pasta in the style of Sicily, using real Sicilian lemons.\nRead More",

We’re not talking about a night at the opera, but about the cherished micro-organisms, also found in yogurt and crème fraîche, which unleash depth and a pleasant tang in cream. Beyond the enviable culture-elicited flavor, butter is better when churned and churned and churned and... Lengthier churning lowers the moisture content, increasing the butterfat, and resulting in luxuriously creamy texture. And because one good churn deserves another, we’re bringing Trader Joe’s Cultured Salted Butter back to our dairy shelves, after a brief (and what some might call heartbreaking) hiatus.\nRead More",

From salty snacks to \"rice,\" to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread.\nTrader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are another way to prove this theorem. Like our Cauliflower Thins, our Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are made of similar ingredients (by the same supplier, in fact). They use shredded cauliflower, whole eggs, and grated Parmesan to create a cohesive \"dough\" that holds together to form a flatbread-like round. Unlike the Thins, however, these Pizza Crusts are twice as large—8 inches vs. 4 inches—and lightly seasoned with garlic and herbs, including basil and oregano.\nRead More",

Taking flavorful cues from equal parts tang and density from sour cream and the sweetness of whipped cream and marrying them together with a classic brie base, Saint André Triple Crème Brie is a cheese for the unyielding connoisseur. Gourmands unite! This Saint André Triple Crème Brie has a bloomy, edible rind surrounding a lusciously smooth, creamy paste made from cow’s milk and enriched with pure cream. This cheese has no less than 75% butterfat making every bite full of dreamy creamy delight.\nRead More",

And so it goes for Key Lime Pie, a treasure of the Florida Keys. We know for certain it originated in Key West in the 1850’s, and we know the key to the magic was (and is) canned sweetened condensed milk, which allowed cooks without easy access to refrigeration to quickly and easily make treats like ice cream or custard. Beyond that, the history gets murky, and really depends on whose story you choose to believe.\nRead More",

No surprise—it’s banana. Or to be more accurate, dehydrated banana flakes. The flake format makes mixing so much easier, and ensures rich, ripe banana flavor, without the risk of a bunch of bananas rotting on your kitchen counter. Natural vanilla flavor and salt further amplify the banana in this Mix, which is complemented by the additions of nutty wheat germ and bran.

Thigh meat is always incredibly flavorful, and that robust flavor is even more pronounced when the skin and bones are left intact. And even more pronounced if you slather them in Organic Sweet & Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce or another saucy favorite while you’re grilling. Not grilling? Not a problem!

It was good, but we thought it could possibly be more meaty and more flavorful. To accomplish this, we reached out to one of our suppliers who makes sauce for a famous NYC Italian restaurant. They knew just how to proceed, beginning with 100% imported Italian tomatoes that have a sweeter profile, ensuring a less acidic, better tasting sauce. To make it meatier, they brilliantly… added more beef! In fact, this new sauce contains 9% beef, compared to the 6% in our previous Bolognese (6% is the industry standard). It may not seem like a lot more, but once you taste it, you’ll definitely see the difference!\nRead More",

And it's really just something you're going to want to put on everything.\nTo create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with kosher salt, and used a flavor base of porcini and white button mushrooms – earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is why we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & black pepper, and thyme. If you follow an eating plan like Paleo or Whole 30, this type of seasoning is a staple. If you follow an eating plan like we do, also known as Anything and Everything, Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend will elevate the flavors of Anything and Everything, a sprinkle at a time.\nRead More",

The ham is matched with Swiss cheese, both of which are presented in a soft egg custard made from a short list of simple ingredients. The Quiche is fully cooked, so you need only heat it and serve, either hot or room temperature. Serve it for breakfast with fresh fruit, or for lunch with fresh greens.

And while we're on the subject, why shouldn't we combine them into one convenient, tasty treat?\nAt Trader Joe's, we don't just ask the tough questions, we answer them. Today, our answer comes in the form of Trader Joe's Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars, a delightfully delicious and properly proteinaceous cereal bar made from a mix of peanuts, soy protein, and brown rice protein that's flavored with the classic sweet-savory combo of dark chocolate and peanut butter. Each bite of one of our Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars starts out with the familiar soft texture of a granola or cereal bar, which gives way to the crunch of the peanuts and crispy soy, which itself turns to satisfying, mouth-filling chewiness. Add to that its almost candy-like peanut butter & chocolate profile and whopping 10 grams of protein per serving, and you've got a bar as utilitarian as it is delicious. With five Bars per box, that's one less weekday snack to worry about!\nRead More",

The soft & chewy vs. crisp & crunchy contrast is crave-able; the crunch factor is amped up with the addition of green and red cabbage, red bell peppers, and dry roasted peanuts. The more aromatic flavors of diced green onion and cilantro enhance the profile, to be sure, but it's the peanut-ginger dressing that Thai-s it all together. (Yes, we did that.) Peanut butter, soy sauce, and rice vinegar make up the dressing base; ginger purée, lemon grass, garlic, lime juice, dried red chili peppers, basil, ground Thai lime leaf, spearmint, and cayenne pepper give it personality galore.\nRead More",

This results in a well-balanced, mild Salame, with subtle notes of spice and a clean, satisfyingly meaty flavor.

Naturally, we turned to these to heat up our spiciest salsa to date-but a little bit goes a long way. The small-but-mighty amount of smoked ghost pepper powder we use is combined with vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh onion, cilantro, habanero peppers, and roasted red bell and poblano peppers. The result? A spicy Salsa that's full of flavor and has that perfect Mexican restaurant-style consistency: not too chunky, and perfectly scoopable.\nRead More",

Our supplier's handling of the corn flour, and their expert approach to cooking it in expeller-pressed oil, has culminated in a light, crisp, crunchy texture.

It's a Japanese Multi-Purpose Seasoning that's a real fan-favorite on the fast-fish scene, and in Japan, it's also added to udon, rice, and so much more. If you're not familiar with Furikake, well... once you taste it, you might just find yourself furikakious that nobody told you about this stuff sooner!\nTrader Joe's Nori Komi Furikake is a blend of tiny, confetti-like strips of dried nori seaweed, black & white sesame seeds, salt, and kelp powder. It's a fairly traditional recipe for Furikake, but with one key difference: no added MSG! Furikake imbues foods with a salty, satisfying, ocean-sesame crunch (not to be confused with open sesame crunch...), and it's good on far more than just fish. It's a great topper or mix-in for rice, eggs, ramen, popcorn, Sriracha Furikake Tofu Fries... You name it!\nRead More",

Speaking of the filling, each triangle is packed corner-to-corner with a curry-like mixture of peas, carrots, potatoes, lentils, onions, and Indian spices. In fact, the filling makes up about 50% of each samosa (versus about 35% in other brands). The vegetables are tender and mildly spicy, offering warm flavors redolent of the Indian subcontinent.\nRead More",

We did not source this Chocolate Milk from chocolate cows. (If only they existed...) Instead, we started by sourcing fair trade cocoa from small family farms in Northern Peru. This cocoa is then mixed with Grade A homogenized whole milk and cane sugar. The resulting concoction is what you'll find in the charming cartons of kosher-certified Chocolate Milk. It's truly the most rich, creamy, dreamy Chocolate Milk we could find. In a glass with a straw. Blended with Trader Joe's ice cream into a milkshake. With Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies for dessert before bed. Don't ask us to pick a favorite way to enjoy this Chocolate Milk—they're all the best. Someday, there might be chocolate cows that produce the most delicious, rich chocolate milk. Until that day comes, you can enjoy Trader Joe's Chocolate Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa.\nRead More",

Whole cashews are roasted and dusted with a seasoning that includes chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. There's also little bit of lime powder and cane sugar to provide hints of acid and sweetness in contrast with the plentiful savoriness. Of course, Chile & Garlic Cashews are excellent eaten out of hand or next to your favorite fizzy beverage- but this flavor profile in particular also works well in recipes, like our Cashew Chicken Lettuce Wraps Recipe.

There are also times when you want a cup of coffee that’s a little more on the mellow side, with strong coffee flavor but without the intensity you get from some brews. Trader Joe’s Organic Breakfast Blend is the coffee for those occasions.\nYou may have noticed a new look for our Organic Breakfast Blend—rather than a canister, it now comes in a valved bag. In addition to being a more efficient form of packaging, the bag also helps protect your coffee, too: when coffee beans are roasted, they emit a small amount of CO2, and can continue to do so even after being sealed in packaging. This valve lets that CO2 escape, without letting any oxygen in, ensuring that your coffee stays fresh and that the bag doesn’t inflate. Ingenious!\nRead More",

Well, we have a treat for you—a treat in the form of Trader Joe’s To the Power of Seven Red Organic Juice Beverage. \nTJ’s To the Power of Seven is no ordinary Juice Beverage. Its sweet, tart, and subtly earthy flavors come courtesy of seven spectacular elements: organic strawberry and cranberry purées, organic hibiscus tea, and a lively, colorful blend of organic beet, watermelon, elderberry, and apple juices. It’s delightful served chilled, all on its own, and is an excellent addition to a morning smoothie (for your sweetheart, perhaps?) made with our Fruits & Greens Smoothie Blend and Lowfat Skyr Yogurt.\nRead More",

Following fermentation, a small amount of fresh (unfermented) apple juice is added, providing a distinct flavor profile. Thanks to the cold and controlled nature of the fermentation process, our brewer is able to produce the perfect amount of subtle sweetness, which elevates Hotspur’s above so many of the other hard ciders on the market. It pours light-golden from the bottle, begins with clean, crisp apple-forward flavors, and delivers a slightly sweet finish.\nRead More",

        "description": "Did you know? Both green and black tea are made with leaves that come from the same species of plant­, Camellia sinensis. The difference in color and flavor between the two is due to the fact that black tea leaves undergo a withering (accelerated drying) and oxidation (curing in a climate-controlled room) process, whereas green tea leaves do not. Hence, green teas, like our Trader Joe’s Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage, have a fresher, more floral, more delicately grassy flavor.\n \nAnd it’s exactly that flavor profile that makes our pre-brewed. ready-to-drink Unsweetend Green Tea Beverage so remarkably refreshing. Equally delicious whether its served hot or chilled, it can be customized with slices of your favorite citrus, muddled with a sprig of mint, or even incorporated into an alluringly aromatic cocktail. We find that its fine, earthy notes are particularly well suited for serving alongside savory pastries, fresh cut melon, and seafood of all kinds. For an extra special treat, try mixing it with our Fresh Squeezed Lemonade in a 1:1 ratio and enjoying with the rice bowl topped with roasted salmon.\nRead More",

Okay, so we don’t technically know when and where the first cup of chai was brewed—but we do know that sometime in the late 19th century, Great Britain was pulling out all the stops in an effort to increase black tea consumption wide and far. Lucky for us, in India, these promotional efforts birthed the ultimate East-meets-West beverage: black tea brewed according to Indian tradition (with plenty of aromatic spices) and served according to British tradition (with plenty of milk and sugar).

One of our longtime favorites from South America, Trader Joe’s Colombia Supremo Coffee, is that kind of coffee.\nSupremo doesn’t just refer to the supreme quality of this coffee, it’s specifically a reference to the largest beans grown in Colombia. Our roasters give these big, 100% Arabica beans from Colombia’s famed Popayan region a medium roast, providing a balanced blend of mild acidity and caramel flavor notes, with a hint of cocoa in the finish.  A superbly satisfying cup of joe to set  your morning up right.\nRead More",

What is it that makes Mango Black Tea such a stalwart on our shelves? It’s just delicious. But why is it delicious? That’s all about what’s inside each tempting tea bag.\nOur Mango Black Tea supplier sources full-flavored black teas from some of the world’s best tea-growing regions – central Africa; Assam, India; and Indonesia. Each of these regions produces teas that convey differ- ent characteristics; bright & invigorating (central Africa), robust & malty (Assam), hearty & medium-bodied (Indonesia). Combined, they create a flavor profile that delivers well-rounded flavors for a lively, bright, and balanced cup. Then, of course, there’s the mango. Here, our supplier has employed natural mango flavor, imparting a hint of the tropics without making the tea overwhelmingly fruity. As we said earlier, it’s just deli- cious. Serve it hot or cold (we recommend steeping it hot before icing for best results) – it’s mango-licious either way!\nRead More",

Steeped in hot water, our bags produce a “tisane,” aka an “herbal infusion”; what most people (not to mention we) call Herbal Tea. Now, since we are being completely thorough, we should also mention that our Ginger Turmeric Tea is significantly more than just ginger and turmeric. It also incorporates licorice root, orange peel, orange oil, and black pepper—all of which are 100% organic, as a matter of fact.\nRead More",

Crafted exclusively for Trader Joe’s by an award-winning brewery in Wisconsin, this is a rich and alluringly aromatic India Pale Ale that conjures complex notes of tropical fruit and citrus zest with every estimable sip. Its near-opaque, Hazy appearance is a visually-intriguing byproduct of adding hops late into the brewing process, which helps preserve the maximum amount of hoppy flavor and helps create an almost creamy mouthfeel. In other words, this is a seriously hoppy IPA.\n\nWe recommend drinking Boatswain Hazy IPA in a tall, frosted glass, paired up with spicy entrées or snacks—food that will hold its own next to this IPA’s creamy bitterness, like a plate of our Spicy Buffalo Cheddar or TJ’s Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings. The IPA may be Hazy, but one thing’s crystal clear: if you’re looking for something bold, citric, and hoppy, it’s time to get on board with Boatswain Hazy IPA!\nRead More",

If we told you we thought we could change that opinion with a single cup of coffee, would you give us the chance?\n\nTrader Joe’s 100% Colombian Instant Coffee is the instant coffee that rocked our tasting panel’s world. It comes to us from a Colombian supplier that grows, harvests, roasts and packs their own beans. (Modern business lingo calls this type of operation vertically integrated; we just call it very intelligent.) Where many instant coffees are freeze dried, our 100% Colombian Instant Coffee is agglomerated, which literally means “formed into a round ball.” In this case, it specifically means that the beans are granulated using a steam-heat process, which makes the coffee incredibly soluble; a heaping teaspoon dissolves quickly and easily into a cup of hot water—no stubborn granules left behind.\nRead More",

With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.\nRead More",

Once bottled, our Juice goes through a cold, water-pressure method called HPP (High Pressure Processing). This process guarantees a juice that’s safe to drink, without reducing its nutritional benefits or fresh flavor. Now, on to more pressing issues… Just how does this stuff taste?

        "description": "What is it about mangos that makes them such a natural partner to spicy flavors? Is it their ripe, tropical juiciness acting as a complementary counterbalance to the heat? Is there, perhaps, some inherent, underlying spiciness within the mango itself? Maybe it’s just an example of mango magic. Whatever the case, we’re all about it, which is precisely why we’ve introduced Trader Joe’s Spicy Mango Lemonade to our refrigerators for the summer. It’s sweet, tart, spicy, and refreshing all at once, making it an ideal beverage for anyone looking for a little something extra in their seasonal sipping.\nRead More",

        "description": "Nothing says “summer” quite like an ice-cold glass of lemonade or limeade. (We’re lime-lovers these days, so let’s focus on the latter.) Sure, you can squeeze the stuff yourself—but it’ll require a whole ’lotta limes, some brute strength, and an ability to tolerate a sticky mess. Or you can simply buy your Fresh Squeezed Limeade at Trader Joe’s.\nMost store-bought limeades only approximate the results you’d get at home and typically include added flavors or even high fructose corn syrup. They’re also typically made from reconstituted lime juice concentrate. Trader Joe’s Fresh Squeezed Limeade, on the other hand, is the closest thing to homemade you’ll find. Our recipe includes only three ingredients: sugar, water, and fresh, not-from-concentrate lime juice (which accounts for around 20% of the recipe!) Our supplier—a third-generation, family-owned fresh juice producer—not only expertly grows, selects, and squeezes the citrus themselves; they also purposely don’t pasteurize the juice, which allows the pure, sweet-tart Limeade flavor to shine through.\nRead More",

Shaped by that tisane uniqueness, Trader Joe's Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend plays to Rooibos's natural strengths by adding in a blend of dried hibiscus, rose hips, orange peel, and a bit of orange oil to give a decidedly citric, tangy, and refreshing character.Because of its lack of caffeine, our Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Tea makes an excellent choice for drinking anytime throughout the day, but we find its toasty orange peel edge is particularly great for sipping during the evening.

We start with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia and heat them to an ideal light roast profile: pleasantly light brown in color, mellow aromatics, and roast just enough to bring out the full body and fruitiness of the Ethiopian beans without sacrificing the acidity and sweet notes of the Guatemalan. Then, we grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness bag. This means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we still recommend approximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water.\nRead More",

Not only does it kill 99.9% of common household bacteria and viruses on all sorts of surfaces, it does so without the use of chlorine bleach, phosphates, or sodium laureth sulfate—and leaves behind a refreshingly sweet Citrus scent, to boot.\n\nMade with a 2.4% solution of hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, this Cleaner truly is All Purpose, adept at dealing with everything from tough grease stains in the kitchen, to mold and mildew in the bathroom. An excellent choice for both big projects and everyday tidying-up, all it takes to effectively clean, deodorize, and disinfect is to spray the affected area with Cleaner until thoroughly wet, allow to sit for 20 minutes, then wipe away.\nRead More",

It replaces the typical two-step shampoo and conditioner hair-care ritual with one product that simultaneously cleans and conditions, leaving your hair soft and shiny!\nMany shampoos contain detergents that strip hair of its natural oils, which often leads to dry strands and itchy scalps. Our Hair Wash doesn’t contain any detergents, sulfates, parabens, or silicone—so you’re left with clean hair, minus the harsh side effects that result from shampoo overuse. Products like this one are often referred to as “co-washes”—conditioners that are used to both wash and condition hair—and they’re becoming a popular alternative for good reason. By co-washing, your hair won’t need to be washed as frequently. It will hydrate dry hair and help tame frizz while enhancing texture and adding volume.\nRead More",

The milk gets boiled, then the curds are wrapped in a thin cloth and hung out to dry for several days. Once the cheese is quite firm, it’s sliced into strips or cubes and dried over a fire or in an oven on low heat.\nRead More",

Heck, even Elvis himself couldn’t say no to that nutty-sweet flavor combination—his favorite food was, famously, a fried Peanut Butter & Banana sandwich.\nRead More",

(Snow White definitely knew—she bunked with seven male miners, for Pete’s sake!) Most space & air-freshening sprays, however, contain a myriad of harsh, synthetic fragrances—and for many, that’s more like a migraine-in-the- making than a breath of fresh air.

Best of all, it smells exactly like a fresh, blooming rose—so you'll actually \"smell the roses\" while you're taking a moment to stop, relax, and... well, smell the roses.

The formula is so mild and gentle that there is really no such thing as \"too much Toner\" here—so feel free to spritz this soothingly-scented spray anytime you need a moment of calm. And here’s a hot tip: for an extra-cool toning experience, store a bottle of Trader Joe’s Rose Water Facial toner in your fridge… and thank us later.\nRead More",
